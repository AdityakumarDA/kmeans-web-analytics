## ✅ Key Features & Benefits

- **User Segmentation:** Divides website users into distinct clusters based on their behavior patterns.
- **Behavioral Insights:** Identifies common engagement and bounce patterns within each cluster.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Enables data-informed decisions regarding website optimization, marketing strategies, and user experience improvements.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Employs the K-Means algorithm to effectively group users with similar behaviors.
- **Python-Based:** Leverages the power and flexibility of Python for data analysis and machine learning.

## 🚀 Usage Examples & API Documentation

This project is driven by a Jupyter Notebook: `ML_project.ipynb`.

### How to Run:

```bash
jupyter notebook ML_project.ipynb
```

### Sample Code Snippet:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("website_traffic_data.csv")

# Select features
features = ['engagement', 'bounce_rate']
X = data[features]

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Apply K-Means
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
data['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

# Review results
print(data.groupby('cluster')[features].mean())
```

---

## 🛠️ Configuration Options

- You can change the number of clusters (`n_clusters`) in the notebook:

```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
```

- Also configurable: features used in clustering (e.g., engagement, bounce rate, session duration).
