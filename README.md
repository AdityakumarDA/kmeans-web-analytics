## Key Features and Benefits

- **User Segmentation:** Divides website users into distinct clusters based on their behavior patterns.
- **Behavioral Insights:** Identifies common engagement and bounce patterns within each cluster.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Enables data-informed decisions regarding website optimization, marketing strategies, and user experience improvements.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Employs the K-Means algorithm to effectively group users with similar behaviors.
- **Python-Based:** Leverages the power and flexibility of Python for data analysis and machine learning.

## Prerequisites and Dependencies

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- Pandas: `pip install pandas`
- Scikit-learn: `pip install scikit-learn`
- Jupyter Notebook (Optional): `pip install notebook`

---

## Installation and Setup Instructions
1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AdityakumarDA/kmeans-web-analytics.git
    cd kmeans-web-analytics
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    It is recommended to create a virtual environment for this project.

    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment (optional)
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

    # Install the required packages
    pip install pandas scikit-learn notebook
    ```

3.  **Download the data**
    Ensure that the `website_traffic_data.csv` is downloaded and placed in the project directory

---

## Usage Examples and API Documentation

This project primarily consists of a Jupyter Notebook (`ML_project.ipynb`) that demonstrates the usage of K-Means clustering.

1.  **Run the Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook ML_project.ipynb
    ```

2.  **Follow the steps within the notebook:** The notebook guides you through data loading, preprocessing, K-Means model training, and cluster analysis.  It leverages Pandas and Scikit-learn functions directly.

    Example snippet (from notebook concept):

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

    # Load the data
    data = pd.read_csv("website_traffic_data.csv")

    # Select features (e.g., 'engagement', 'bounce_rate')
    features = ['engagement', 'bounce_rate']
    X = data[features]

    # Standardize the features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

    # Apply K-Means clustering
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)  # Example: 3 clusters
    data['cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

    # Analyze the clusters
    print(data.groupby('cluster')[features].mean())
    ```

---

## Configuration Options

The primary configurable option is the number of clusters (`n_clusters`) in the K-Means algorithm. This can be adjusted within the `ML_project.ipynb` notebook. Experiment with different values to find the optimal number of clusters for your dataset. Also the features that are used for clustering are configurable.

```python
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42) # change n_clusters
```

## Visual Output Snapshots

### 1. üîç Search Volume vs Traffic Cost

![Search Volume vs Traffic Cost](images/trafficcost_vs_Search_volume.png)

This scatter plot visualizes how **Search Volume** impacts the **Traffic Cost** for various website keywords or landing pages. It helps identify outliers ‚Äî e.g., terms with exceptionally high traffic costs or volume. This can assist in budget optimization for paid campaigns or SEO strategy.

---

### 2. üí° Elbow Method to Determine Optimal Clusters

![Elbow Plot](images/elbow_plot.png)

The **Elbow Method** helps us decide the optimal number of clusters (`n_clusters`) for K-Means. It plots the number of clusters vs the clustering inertia (error). The 'elbow point' (highlighted with a red star) indicates the most efficient number of clusters ‚Äî beyond which performance gain diminishes. In this project, 2 clusters were optimal.

---

### 3. üìä K-Means Cluster Scatter Plot (Search Volume vs Traffic)

![Cluster Scatter Plot](images/cluster_scatter.png)

This plot displays final **K-Means clustering results**, where:
- Each point is a data sample (a keyword or page).
- Different colors indicate different user segments (clusters).
- **Red stars** mark the centroids (mean position of each cluster).

It provides intuitive insights into user groupings like high-volume, low-cost vs low-volume, high-cost clusters. This is essential for personalized targeting and marketing strategies.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add features like session duration, pages per session
- Use silhouette score for better cluster selection
- Deploy via Streamlit/Flask for interactivity
- Add time-series or location-based segmentation
